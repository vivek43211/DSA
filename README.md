<h4>Time Complexity</h4>
<p>Basically, the time complexity of a particular code depends on the given input size, not on the machine used to run the code.</p>
<h4>Space Complexity</h4>
<p>Space complexity generally represents the summation of auxiliary space and the input space. Auxiliary space refers to the space that we use additionally to solve a problem. And input space refers to the space that we use to store the inputs.
